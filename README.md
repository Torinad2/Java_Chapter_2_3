Starting out with Java. Chapter 2, Assignment 3: Personal Information. 

Personal Information
Write a program that displays the following information, each on a separate line:

• Your name
• Your address, with city, state, and ZIP
• Your telephone number
• Your college major

Although these items should be displayed on separate output lines, use only a single println
statement in your program.
